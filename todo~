- add stdcntrl include at top of pddd.h, and remove individual references
- start using clang-format/GNU indent on completed files w/emacs header + vim modeline footer or no header/footer
  - also refer to https://man.openbsd.org/style
  - and https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html

- add copyright header to each page (copyright notice + applicable GPL info) (add SPDX header to all files)
  - reference https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/process/license-rules.html for populating project 'LICENSE' folder
  - probably dual-license (gpl2 + bsd 2-clause)
  - probably also define a static string somewhere that has the copyright notice

- get lgtm account for code quality/license buttons in git repo/readme

- internationalization (gnu gettext? NLS?)

- replace recursive functions w/iterative ones + re-test
- add helper functions to find lowest node/link/adj ID
- re-write pathfinding function w/dijkstra on every combo (one basic function for all)

- add doxygen comments

- replace malloc's with calloc's
- replace arrays with pointers/pointer arithmetic
- fix function callers/callees with double-pointer/address-of syntax
- make no_GENID version of create_node, etc.

- go back and comment on lint option comments
- test get_ls_metric against all combinations
- figure out optimization crash issue
  - try to move stack-based arrays into dynamically-alloc'd buffers
- update 'functions.txt'
- start consolidating + commenting functions
- verify consistency in function naming conventions
- consolidate the use of topology_dbs with individual data structures in functions (i.e. only use topology_dbs if more than one datatype is being ingested)
- traceroute stuff:
  - make function work with IDs, and not just keys (or make second function for IDs, etc.)
    - maybe make a function to sort node_libs by ID to help?
- solidify get_ls_metric function (memory management + formatting + safety checks)
  - Make sure all variables are accounted for (i.e. null-checks, asserts, etc)
- write get_node_by_root_metric function (return count of all the nodes that have the specified root_metric)
- write nlink->ID addition function
  - write ID comparison + sort functions
- unify function naming conventions
- add ip_addr values to node structs
- create testunits.c file, call run_testunits() from main()
- prettify the files (comments, headers, formatting, compactness, etc)
  - remove C++ style comments
- get rid of POSIX'93 defs (add to makefile instead)
