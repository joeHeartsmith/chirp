  description of generic path-finding algo
   - basic list-building behavior
   - discovery of all path lengths ahead-of-time

  justification
   - enables flexibility; all paths are searched, so if program changes, the algo doesn't have to
   - works fine; how damn big do you expect these networks to be?
